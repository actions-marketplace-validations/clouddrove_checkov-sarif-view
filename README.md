## Features:
- Parses SARIF files generated by Checkov.
- Post detailed security findings as PR comments.
- Links to the exact location of the issue in the code.
- Easy-to-read format with rule details, code snippets, and references.

## Inputs:
- `github_token` (required): GitHub token for API access. Default: `${{ github.token }}`
- `sarif_file` (required): Path to the Checkov SARIF results file. Default: `results.sarif`

## Usage:
1. **Set up the GitHub Action in your repository:**
   - Create a `.github/workflows/tf-scan.yml` file in your repository with the following content:

```yaml
name: Checkov Security Scan Example

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master ]

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Run Checkov scan
        uses: bridgecrewio/checkov-action@master
        with:
          directory: .
          output_format: sarif
          output_file: results.sarif

      - name: Post Checkov results to PR
        uses: ${{ github.repository }}@${{ github.ref_name }}
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          sarif_file: results.sarif
```
2.  **Configure the workflow to run Checkov and post results as PR comments:**

    The action will automatically scan your code for any security vulnerabilities and post a comment on the PR with detailed results.
